    <h1>Web Technologies Cheat Sheet</h1>

    <h2>World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed through the internet. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. The three essential technologies behind the web are:
        - **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language): The standard language for creating web pages.
        - **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator): The address used to locate web resources.
        - **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol for transferring web pages between clients and servers.
    </p>

    <h2>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
    <p>
        A URL is an address that points to a resource on the web. The structure of a URL includes:
        - **Protocol**: Defines the method to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
        - **Domain**: Identifies the website (e.g., example.com).
        - **Path**: Specifies the location of the page or file on the server (e.g., /about).
        - **Query**: Optional parameters passed to the server (e.g., ?id=123).
        Example: `https://www.example.com/about?user=123`
    </p>

    <h2>Web Server</h2>
    <p>
        A web server is responsible for storing, processing, and delivering web pages to clients (web browsers). When a browser sends a request to a web server, it responds with the requested resource (e.g., an HTML page). Common web servers include Apache and Nginx.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Browser</h2>
    <p>
        A web browser is software that retrieves, displays, and allows users to interact with web pages. It sends requests to web servers and renders the returned content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Popular browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    </p>

    <h2>DOCTYPE Declaration</h2>
    <p>
        The `DOCTYPE` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It must be placed at the top of an HTML document. Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<html>` element is the root of an HTML document. It contains all other HTML elements. Example: `<html lang="en">`
    </p>

    <h2>Head Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<head>` element contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the title and character encoding. Example: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
    </p>

    <h2>Title Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<title>` element defines the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab. Example: `<title>Web Technologies Cheat Sheet</title>`
    </p>

    <h2>Body Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<body>` element contains the content that is visible to users, including text, images, and links. Example: `<body>Content goes here</body>`
    </p>

    <h2>Strong Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<strong>` element is used to indicate important text, which is typically displayed in bold. Example: `<strong>Important!</strong>`
    </p>

    <h2>Em Tag</h2>
    <p>
        The `<em>` element is used to emphasize text, which is typically displayed in italics. Example: `<em>Emphasized text</em>`
    </p>

</body>
</html>
